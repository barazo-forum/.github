# Singi Labs — Engineering

The shared engineering harness for every Singi Labs repo (Barazo + Sifa). One
canonical home; product docs and per-repo files link here rather than copying, so
nothing drifts.

| Doc | What it's for |
|---|---|
| [`harness.md`](harness.md) | How we engineer with AI agents — the operating model, what the harness enforces, what you inherit vs. what's maintainer-only. Read this first. |
| [`agent-instructions.md`](agent-instructions.md) | Drop-in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` for your local clone so your coding agent stays in bounds. |
| [`templates/pr-gates.yml`](templates/pr-gates.yml) | Caller workflow a repo adds to run the shared secret scan on every PR. |
| [`standards/`](standards/) | The engineering standards the AI reviewer and maintainers enforce (see below). |

### Standards

The single source of truth for our engineering conventions — referenced by every
repo's `AGENTS.md` rather than copied:

| Doc | Scope |
|---|---|
| [`standards/shared.md`](standards/shared.md) | Cross-cutting: testing, CI/CD, git workflow, dependencies |
| [`standards/backend.md`](standards/backend.md) | Backend patterns, API conventions, data, security |
| [`standards/frontend.md`](standards/frontend.md) | Frontend patterns, accessibility, components |
| [`standards/atproto-conventions.md`](standards/atproto-conventions.md) | AT Protocol conventions |
| [`standards/naming-lexicon.md`](standards/naming-lexicon.md) | Lexicon naming rules |
| [`standards/quality-measures.md`](standards/quality-measures.md) | Quality, security & reliability overview |
| [`standards/readme-template.md`](standards/readme-template.md) | README template for repos |

## The harness has two halves

- **Prose** — the docs above and each repo's `AGENTS.md`. Tells you the rules.
- **Executable** — git hooks, CI gates, secret scanning, branch protection, the
  automated reviewer. *Enforces* the rules without depending on anyone remembering.

The executable half is the one that holds. See `harness.md` for why.

## Adding the shared secret scan to a repo

Copy [`templates/pr-gates.yml`](templates/pr-gates.yml) to the repo as
`.github/workflows/pr-gates.yml`. It calls the org's reusable
[`secret-scan`](../.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml) workflow — change the scan
once here and every repo that references it gets the update.
